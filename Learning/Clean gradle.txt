Here is solution in my case.

Open your flutter Project directory.
Change directory to android directory in your flutter project directory cd android
clean gradle ./gradlew clean
Build gradle ./gradlew build or you can combine both commands with just ./gradlew clean build (Thanks @daniel for the tip)
Now run your flutter project. If you use vscode, press F5. First time gradle running assembleDebug will take time.
PS: Delete gradle in case of all that steps d
